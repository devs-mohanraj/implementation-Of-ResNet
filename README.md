                   ResNet implementation
ResNet was designed to tackle the issue of vanishing gradients in deep networks, which was a major hindrance in developing deep neural networks. The ResNet architecture enables the network to learn multiple layers of features without getting stuck in local minima, a common issue with deep networks.

                Example of Image Recognition
thses are the examples of the image recognition done using the ResNet model with the CIFAR10 dataset.
